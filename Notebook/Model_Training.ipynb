{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 🧠 **Model Training and Evaluation**\n","\n","This notebook focuses on training, tuning, and evaluating multiple machine learning models for fraud detection on both original and augmented datasets. The goal is to identify the model that best balances recall, precision, and F1-score, ensuring maximum detection of fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.\n","\n","The workflow includes:\n","\n","  * Data preparation and preprocessing (feature encoding, scaling, handling imbalance).\n","\n","  * Model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SGD, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Balanced Random Forest.\n","\n","  * Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance on the augmented data.\n","\n","  * Evaluation and comparison based on metrics — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.\n","\n","  * Insights and interpretation to select the most suitable model for real-world fraud detection scenarios.\n","\n","The analysis highlights that while tree-based ensemble models like CatBoost and XGBoost achieve high recall (detecting most fraudulent cases), models such as LightGBM and Logistic Regression offer a better balance between sensitivity and precision."],"metadata":{"id":"jFIY28bk7snI"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8551,"status":"ok","timestamp":1759768036411,"user":{"displayName":"Sajrudin
